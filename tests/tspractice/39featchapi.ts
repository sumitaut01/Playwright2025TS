1. async () => { ... }

This is an async arrow function.

async means:

The function always returns a Promise.

You can use await inside it.

So this defines a function that is asynchronous.

ðŸ”¹ 2. await fetch('')

fetch('') â†’ calls the Fetch API (here with an empty URL, which would actually throw an error in real use).

fetch returns a Promise<Response>.

await pauses execution until the Promise is resolved, and then assigns the resolved Response object to resp.

So resp will be a Response object you can use to read JSON, text, etc.

Example:

async () => {
  const resp = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
  const data = await resp.json();
  console.log(data);
}

ðŸ”¹ 3. Important Note

Just writing:

async () => {
  const resp = await fetch('');
}


only defines the function. It does not run it.
To run it, you need to either:

Call it:

(async () => {
  const resp = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
  const data = await resp.json();
  console.log(data);
})(); // <- this () at the end calls it


Or assign it to a variable and call later:

const myFunc = async () => {
  const resp = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
  const data = await resp.json();
  console.log(data);
};

myFunc();


âœ… So in short:
That line defines an async arrow function that uses await to wait for the result of a fetch call. But unless you call the function, nothing happens.
